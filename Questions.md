# Research Questions

## Main Question
At low pT (trigger) and pT (associated) pairs, what are the contributions from single-jet, dijet, and multi-jet events?

We are especially interested in the contributions from multi-jet events, since we want to see the effect of jet fragmentation on the correlation plots.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Determine jet multiplicity**: Calculate the relative jet rate and how many jets per event
2. **Fill dihadron correlations**: Fill dihadron correlations per jet multiplicity category
3. **Use jAnaSimple**: Utilize the jAnaSimple analysis framework for this study
